The documentation for this puppet module is handled by [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/), a web service dedicated to documentation management for the open source community.

* [Reference documentation](https://docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)

By default, the [puppet-sysadmins](https://github.com/ULHPC/puppet-sysadmins) repository is bound to the [ulhpc-puppet-sysadmins](http://ulhpc-puppet-sysadmins.rtfd.org) project on Read the Docs (to avoid confusion with other sysadmins projects). 

You might wish to generate locally the docs:

* Install [`mkdocs`](http://www.mkdocs.org/#installation)
* Preview your documentation from the project root by running `mkdocs serve` and visite with your favorite browser the URL `http://localhost:8000`
* build the full documentation locally by running `mkdocs build`
